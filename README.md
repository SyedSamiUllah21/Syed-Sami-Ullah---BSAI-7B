# Data Visualization — BSAI-7B

Coursework for the Data Visualization course, organised by week.

| Week | Topic | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Why we visualize, and choosing the right chart | [`week1/`](week1/) |
| 2 | Visual perception — preattentive attributes, Gestalt, cognitive load | [`week2/`](week2/) |
| 3 | Matplotlib & Seaborn — nine charts that are wrong, Lie Factor, CVD-safe palettes, the clinical review figure | [`week3/`](week3/) |

Notebooks are committed with their outputs, so the charts are readable on GitHub without running anything.

## Running the notebooks

# Week 1
cd week1
python download_assignment_data.py
jupyter notebook

# Week 2
cd week2
python download_assignment_data.py
